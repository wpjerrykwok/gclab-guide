# Build a Website on Google Cloud: Challenge Lab

## GSP319

### Introduction

In a challenge lab youâ€™re given a scenario and a set of tasks. 

Instead of following step-by-step instructions, you will use the skills learned from the labs in the course to figure out how to complete the tasks on your own!

### Challenge scenario

You have just started a new role at FancyStore, Inc.

Your task is to take the company's existing monolithic e-commerce website and break it into a series of logically separated microservices. 

The existing monolith code is sitting in a GitHub repo, and you will be expected to containerize this app and then refactor it.

You are expected to have the skills and knowledge for these tasks, so don't expect step-by-step guides.

You have been asked to take the lead on this, after the last team suffered from monolith-related burnout and left for greener pastures (literally, they are running a lavender farm now). 

You will be tasked with pulling down the source code, building a container from it (one of the farmers left you a Dockerfile), and then pushing it out to GKE.

You should first build, deploy, and test the Monolith, just to make sure that the source code is sound. 

After that, you should break out the constituent services into their own microservice deployments.

Some FancyStore, Inc. standards you should follow:

- Create your cluster in `us-east4`

- Naming is normally team-resource, e.g. an instance could be named `fancystore-orderservice1`.

- Allocate cost effective resource sizes. Projects are monitored and excessive resource use will result in the containing project's termination.

- Use the `e2-medium` machine type unless directed otherwise.

### Setup

```bash
export ZONE=
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=
export MONOLITH_IDENTIFIER=
export CLUSTER_NAME=
export ORDERS_IDENTIFIER=
export PRODUCTS_IDENTIFIER=
export FRONTEND_IDENTIFIER=

gcloud services enable cloudbuild.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable container.googleapis.com
```

### Task 1. Download the monolith code and build your container

Log in to your new project and open up Cloud Shell.

First things first, you'll need to clone your team's git repo. 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/googlecodelabs/monolith-to-microservices.git
```

There's a `setup.sh` script in the root directory of the project that you'll need to run to get your monolith container built up.

```bash
cd ~/monolith-to-microservices
./setup.sh
```

After running the `setup.sh` script, ensure your Cloud Shell is running its latest version of nodeJS:

```bash
nvm install --lts
```

There will be a few different projects that can be built and pushed.

Push the monolith build (conveniently located in the `monolith` directory) up to the Artifact Registry. 

There's a Dockerfile located in the `~/monotlith-to-microservices/monolith` folder which you can use to build the application container.

You will have to run Cloud Build (in that monolith folder) to build it, then push it up to Artifact Registry.

Name your artifact as follows:

- Repo: `gcr.io/${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT}`
- Image name: `fancy-monolith-521`
- Image version: `1.0.0`

> Hint: Make sure that you submit a build named `fancy-monolith-521` with a version of `1.0.0`.

```bash
cd ~/monolith-to-microservices/monolith
gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT}/${MONOLITH_IDENTIFIER}:1.0.0 .
```

### Task 2. Create a kubernetes cluster and deploy the application

Now that you have the image created and sitting in the Artifact Registry, it's time to create a cluster to deploy it to.

You've been told to deploy all of your resources in the `us-east4-a` zone, so first you'll need to create a GKE cluster for it. Start with a `3` node cluster to begin with.

Create your cluster as follows:

- Cluster name: `fancy-production-771`
- Region: `us-east4`
- Node count: `3`

> Hint: Make sure your cluster is named fancy-production-771, and is in the running state in `us-east4`.

```bash
gcloud config set compute/zone $ZONE
gcloud container clusters create $CLUSTER_NAME --num-nodes 3
gcloud container clusters get-credentials $CLUSTER_NAME
```

Now that you've built up an image, and have a cluster up and running, it's time to deploy your application.

You'll need to deploy the image that you've built onto your cluster. 

This will get your application up and running, but it can't be accessed until you expose it to the outside world. 

Your team has told you that the application runs on port `8080`, but you will need to expose this on a more consumer-friendly port `80`.

Create and expose your deployment as follows:

- Cluster name: `fancy-production-771`
- Container name: `fancy-monolith-521`
- Container version: `1.0.0`
- Application port: `8080`
- Externally accessible port: `80`

> Note: For purposes of this lab, exposure of the service has been simplified. Typically, you would use an API gateway to secure your public endpoints. Learn more about best practices in the Best practices for microservices Guide.

> Make note of the IP address that is assigned in the expose deployment operation. You should now be able to visit this IP address from your browser!

> Hint: Make sure your deployment is named `fancy-monolith-521`, and that you have exposed the service on port `80`, and mapped it to port `8080`.

```bash
kubectl create deployment $MONOLITH_IDENTIFIER \ 
  --image=gcr.io/${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT}/${MONOLITH_IDENTIFIER}:1.0.0
kubectl expose deployment $MONOLITH_IDENTIFIER \ 
  --type=LoadBalancer --port 80 --target-port 8080
```

Now that you can build and deploy your Fancy Store monolith application, you're ready to start breaking it down into microservices!

#### Migrate monolith to microservices

Now that you have your existing monolith website running on GKE, you can start breaking each service into a microservice. 

Typically, a planning effort should take place on which services to break into smaller chunks, typically around specific parts of the application like business domain.

For the purposes of this Challenge, fast forward a bit and pretend that you have successfully broken out the monolith into a series of microservices: Orders, Products, and Frontend. 

Your code is ready, so now you've got to deploy your services.

### Task 3. Create new microservices

There are 3 services that need to be broken out into their own containers. 

Since you are moving all of the services into containers, you need to track the following information for each service:

- The root folder of the service (where you will build the container)
- The repository you will upload the container to
- The name & version of the container artifact

#### Create a containerized version of your microservices

Below is the set of services which need to be containerized.

Navigate to the source roots mentioned below, and upload the artifacts that are created to the Artifact Registry with the metadata indicated:

- Orders Microservice

  - Service root folder: `~/monolith-to-microservices/microservices/src/orders`

  - GCR Repo: `gcr.io/${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT}`

  - Image name: `fancy-orders-496`

  - Image version: `1.0.0`

- Products Microservice

  - Service root folder: `~/monolith-to-microservices/microservices/src/products`

  - GCR Repo: `gcr.io/${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT}`

  - Image name: `fancy-products-810`

  - Image version: `1.0.0`

Once these microservices have been containerized, and their images uploaded to Artifact Registry, you should deploy and expose these services.

> Hint: Make sure that you submit a build named `fancy-orders-496` with a version of "1.0.0", AND a build named `fancy-products-810` with a version of "1.0.0".

```bash
cd ~/monolith-to-microservices/microservices/src/orders
gcloud builds submit \ 
  --tag gcr.io/${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT}/${ORDERS_IDENTIFIER}:1.0.0 .
```

```bash
cd ~/monolith-to-microservices/microservices/src/products
gcloud builds submit \ 
  --tag gcr.io/${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT}/${PRODUCTS_IDENTIFIER}:1.0.0 .
```

### Task 4. Deploy the new microservices

Deploy these new containers following the same process that you followed for the `fancy-monolith-521` monolith. 

Note that these services will be listening on different ports, so make note of the port mappings in the table below.

Create and expose your deployments as follows:

- Orders Microservice

  - Cluster name: `fancy-production-771`

  - Container name: `fancy-orders-496`

  - Container version: `1.0.0`

  - Application port: `8081`

  - Externally accessible port: `80`

- Products Microservice

  - Cluster name: `fancy-production-771`

  - Container name: `fancy-products-810`

  - Container version: `1.0.0`

  - Application port: `8082`

  - Externally accessible port: `80`

> NOTE: Please make note of the IP address of both the Orders and Products services once they have been exposed, you will need them in future steps.

You can verify that the deployments were successful and that the services have been exposed by going to the following URLs in your browser:

`http://ORDERS_EXTERNAL_IP/api/orders`

`http://PRODUCTS_EXTERNAL_IP/api/products`

You will see each service return a JSON string if the deployments were successful.

> Hint: Make sure your deployments are named `fancy-orders-496` and `fancy-products-810`, and that you see the services exposed on port 80.

```bash
kubectl create deployment $ORDERS_IDENTIFIER \ 
  --image=gcr.io/${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT}/${ORDERS_IDENTIFIER}:1.0.0
kubectl expose deployment $ORDERS_IDENTIFIER \ 
  --type=LoadBalancer \ 
  --port 80 \ 
  --target-port 8081
kubectl get svc -w
```

```bash
kubectl create deployment $PRODUCTS_IDENTIFIER \ 
  --image=gcr.io/${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT}/${PRODUCTS_IDENTIFIER}:1.0.0
kubectl expose deployment $PRODUCTS_IDENTIFIER \ 
  --type=LoadBalancer \ 
  --port 80 \ 
  --target-port 8082
kubectl get svc -w
```

### Task 5. Configure and deploy the Frontend microservice

Now that you have extracted both the Orders and Products microservice, you need to configure the Frontend service to point to them, and get it deployed.

#### Reconfigure Frontend

Use the **nano** editor to replace the local URL with the IP address of the new Products microservices:

```bash
cd ~/monolith-to-microservices/react-app
nano .env
```

When the editor opens, your file should look like this:

```bash
REACT_APP_ORDERS_URL=http://localhost:8081/api/orders
REACT_APP_PRODUCTS_URL=http://localhost:8082/api/products
```

Replace the `REACT_APP_PRODUCTS_URL` to the new format while replacing with your Orders and Product microservice IP addresses so it matches below:

```bash
REACT_APP_ORDERS_URL=http://<ORDERS_IP_ADDRESS>/api/orders
REACT_APP_PRODUCTS_URL=http://<PRODUCTS_IP_ADDRESS>/api/products
```

Press **CTRL+O**, press **ENTER**, then **CTRL+X** to save the file in the nano editor.

Now rebuild the frontend app before containerizing it:

```bash
npm run build
```

### Task 6. Create a containerized version of the Frontend microservice

With the Orders and Products microservices now containerized and deployed, and the Frontend service configured to point to them, the final step is to containerize and deploy the Frontend.

Use Cloud Build to package up the contents of the Frontend service and push it up to Artifact Registry.

- Service root folder: `~/monolith-to-microservices/microservices/src/frontend`

- Repo: `gcr.io/${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT}`

- Image name: `fancy-frontend-206`

- Image version: `1.0.0`

This process may take a few minutes, so be patient.

> Hint: Make sure that you submit a build named `fancy-frontend-206` with a version of `1.0.0`.

```bash
cd ~/monolith-to-microservices/microservices/src/frontend
gcloud builds submit \ 
  --tag gcr.io/${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT}/${FRONTEND_IDENTIFIER}:1.0.0 .
```

### Task 7. Deploy the Frontend microservice

Deploy this container following the same process that you followed for the "Orders" and "Products" microservices.

Create and expose your deployment as follows:

- Cluster name: `fancy-production-771`

- Container name: `fancy-frontend-206`

- Container version: `1.0.0`

- Application port: `8080`

- Externally accessible port: `80`

You can verify that the deployment was successful and that the microservices have been properly exposed by hitting the following the IP address of the frontend service in your browser.

You will see the Fancy Store homepage, with links to the Products and Orders pages powered by your new microservices.

```bash
kubectl create deployment $FRONTEND_IDENTIFIER \ 
  --image=gcr.io/${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT}/${FRONTEND_IDENTIFIER}:1.0.0
kubectl expose deployment $FRONTEND_IDENTIFIER \ 
  --type=LoadBalancer \ 
  --port 80 \ 
  --target-port 8080
kubectl get svc -w
```

Congratulations!
